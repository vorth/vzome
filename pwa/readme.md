This is an experimental subproject to create a simplified, online, vZome-like editor.  It has been superseded by
the `online` subproject.  Nonetheless, I'm keeping this around for the moment, until I confirm that
all the value has been extracted.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
However, I have removed the `package.json` and supporting files, to eliminate dependency warnings from GitHub.
