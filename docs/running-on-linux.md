Since vZome 7.1, we have been shipping a [Debian package for vZome](https://www.vzome.com/download/7.1/latest/linux/vZome-Linux-7.1.deb).

Unlike prior vZome packages for Linux, this package does include its own JRE (Java runtime environment).  I have tested it successfully (though slowly) on a virtual machine running Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS.  When I clicked on the `.deb` file, I was offered a choice of two apps to open it with, and I selected the "Software Installer", which successfully performed the package installation.

If you have difficulties with this or any other Linux distribution, please contact `support@vzome.com`.
