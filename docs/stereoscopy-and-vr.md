# Stereoscopy and Virtual Reality

I have always had an interest in [stereoscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy).
Even as a child, simple tricks like the [floating finger](https://youtu.be/2Z3uIZ__5Ug) fascinated me.

In fifth grade I recall seeing a collection of stereographs
made from aerial photos of geological features,
viewed with a folding stereoscope
[like this](https://www.berezin.com/3d/Mapscope.htm).

Most interesting were the occasional stereographs of molecules that would appear
in Scientific American magazine; here the value of stereo vision was most obvious.

When I took a January-term course in computer graphics in 1980,
my crowning achievement was a stereograph of a dodecahedron, printed
on a [Hewlett-Packard 4-pen plotter](http://hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=79).
