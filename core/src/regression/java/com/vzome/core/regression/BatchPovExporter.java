/**
 * Exports every ".vZome" file under a folder to POV-Ray format, writing the results into a
 * mirrored folder hierarchy.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *
 *   record  (no golden folder)  -- write the ".pov" files.  This produces the golden baseline.
 *   compare (golden folder set) -- write the ".pov" files, then compare each one against the
 *                                  corresponding file in the golden tree, and exit non-zero if
 *                                  anything differs or fails.  This is the regression test.
 *
 * Comparison is plain equality, which only works because POVRayExporter now emits its
 * manifestations in a deterministic, content-derived order.
 *
 * PARALLELISM IS BY PROCESS, NOT BY THREAD.  Loading a design cannot be done concurrently
 * within one JVM: XmlSaveFormat instances are cached in a static map (XmlSaveFormat.FORMATS)
 * but carry per-document state -- initialize() sets the field, scale and multiplier that are
 * then read throughout history replay -- so two simultaneous loads corrupt each other, and
 * designs fail to open at random.  Loading is also ~96% of the runtime, so serializing just
 * the load would leave almost nothing to parallelize anyway (measured: 35.2s with 6 threads
 * and a load lock, versus 36.6s single-threaded).
 *
 * Instead, --split/--shard let several independent JVMs each take a slice of the files.
 * Statics are not shared between processes, so this is both correct and genuinely parallel.
 * Use the "batchPov" Gradle task, which forks the workers for you.
