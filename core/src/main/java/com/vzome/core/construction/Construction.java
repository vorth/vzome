/*
 * I have made the following tentative determinations:
 * 
 * 1. There is such a thing as a free point, even if there's no way currently
 *     to manipulate it in all three dimensions at once.  Dragging will always
 *     use a "current grid" - a plane plus a grid scale, not stored in the model.
 * 
 * 2. Basic, from-where-you-stopped strut building is modeled with an "anchored segment",
 *     construction, which has only a "start" point parent, and a "segment end" point
 *     construction that can be (auto) derived from it.  This is simpler, I think, than the
 *     "offset point" with a 2-ended segment derived... less redundancy.
 * 
 * 3. Dragging a derivative construction drags the "nearest", most constrained ancestor
 *     from those ancestors that are not fully constrained.  If all candidate ancestors
 *     are free, the current grid is used as a constraint.
 * 
 * 4. Transformation is derived from its parameters, but not from its inputs.  It shows up
 *     as a derivative of its parameters.  It has derivatives of its own, one for each input.
 *     Each transformed derivative has its prototype as a parent, but not its Transformation;
 *     the transformation is treated as an attribute.  This implies a collection of
 *     "Transformed<construction>" constructions, probably one each for point, segment,
 *     polygon, and polyhedron.
 * 
 * 5. Any partially or fully constrained construction may have attributes (not parents)
 *     that can be edited, usually by constrained dragging.  This is very distinct from
 *     dragging of constructions as described in #3.  Attributes may be axis, color, scale,
 *     length (etc?), and combinations thereof.  The "anchored segment" construction described
 *     in #2 has attributes axis, scale, and length.
