# vZome Online

Online vZome is a web application, but also a set of related web applications (and web components) using shared code.

There are three ways you can work with this code.
Option 1 requires nothing but your existing web browser.
Options 2 and 3 both require [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
installed on your local computer;
they differ in what other prerequisites must be installed.

## Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Quick Start)

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/vZome/vzome)

The easiest way to experiment with this code is to click the badge above.
This will give you a [codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces),
which is a Visual Studio Code development environment running in your web browser,
backed by a Docker container running on a remote virtual machine somewhere in GitHub's cloud.
The downside here is the time to set up the codespace, and the lag you will see when testing.

> Note: the badge above opens a codespace on the official vZome repo.
> This is fine for experimentation, but *if you intend to contribute
> changes back*, you should fork that repo and open your codespace on your own fork, using the green
> "Code" button in GitHub, under the "Codespaces" tab there. 

If you're familiar with VS Code, you'll notices some minor differences in the web version.
Most importantly, the usual menubar seems to be missing, but you can find it by clicking on
the triple-bar icon in the upper left of the page.

Starting the codespace can take a couple of minutes, and there are several phases.
Once your codespace is completely ready, you can proceed to the next step.

### Start the Development Server

Find the "Terminal" menu in VS Code, and click on "Run Build Task..." (shift-command-B on a Mac),
then select `Build vZome for Development`.
This task builds all the online apps and components, then starts a dev server.
Finally, it will automatically open the test page (see below) in your browser.

### Testing

The test page contains links to the various web apps, as well as different web components and their configuration options,
for manual testing.
(Unfortunately, there is no automated testing implemented at the moment.)
You can see the [test page source here](./serve/app/test/index.html).

### Debugging

With the dev server running, you can go to "Run and Debug" in the activity bar of VS Code,
and you'll see a drop-down menu at the top, showing launch configurations.
Select the `TEST` configuration, and hit the green "play" button to debug the Javascript code for any
online vZome web application or web component.
If you have Chrome installed, VS Code will ask for permission (once)
then will launch a special Chrome instance, connected to the VS Code debugging framework and
showing the test page.  Breakpoints you set in VS Code will be triggered by that browser.

## Option 2: Local Docker

If you do lots of development, you may have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed already.
If you do, you can skip installing other vZome prerequisite tools by using the same "dev container" that GitHub Codespaces would use, but
running on your own machine, in your Docker host.

In this case, when you open the top level vzome folder in VS Code, it will offer to "Reopen in Container".
Accept that, and wait for the workspace to be ready.

Once the workspace is ready, you can [start the dev server](#start-the-development-server)
and continue with the workflow as documented in Option 1 above.

With the dev server running, you can [visit the test page here](http://localhost:8532/app/test/).

## Option 3: Local Node.js

If you don't want to install and manage Docker,
you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install);
the `online.bash` script uses `yarn` explicitly, not `npm`.

Node.js is only used as a tooling framework.  None of the vZome web apps require a server side running in Node.

With this project open in VS Code, you can [start the dev server](#start-the-development-server)
and continue with the workflow as documented in Option 1 above.

With the dev server running, you can [visit the test page here](http://localhost:8532/app/test/).

## Official Builds

The `Build vZome for Production` task in VS Code builds all the online apps and components, then prepares the files for
the production server, and creates an archive under the `online/dist` folder.

All official builds for online vZome are performed using GitHub Actions.  See `.github/workflows/online.yml`.

## Clean Up

The `vZome online: Clean` task removes all temporary files and build artifacts.

## Legacy Code

The `online/src/worker/legacy/ts/` folder holds 433 TypeScript modules that were
originally transpiled from this repository's Java `core` (and parts of `desktop`) with
[JSweet](https://www.jsweet.org/).

**That transpile can no longer be run** — it depended on custom branches of four
repositories whose Artifactory server is permanently offline — so the TypeScript has been
adopted as source and is now edited directly.  There is no Java build step in the online
workflow any more: `cicd/online.bash dev` is the whole story, and esbuild consumes the
`.ts` files directly.

The important consequence is that nothing keeps the two languages in agreement:

    core/src/main/java/com/vzome/core/edits/Foo.java     drives desktop vZome
    online/src/worker/legacy/ts/com/vzome/core/edits/Foo.ts    drives online vZome

**A change to either must be mirrored by hand in the other.**  A missed mirror passes both
`./gradlew core:test` and `yarn typecheck` — each tree still compiles — and the two
versions of vZome simply behave differently.

See [`src/worker/legacy/ts/README.md`](./src/worker/legacy/ts/README.md) for what to know
before editing that tree, and the *Coding Conventions* section of the repository's
`AGENTS.md` for the mirroring rule in full.

### Typechecking

```
cd online && yarn typecheck
```

This is the only automated check the legacy tree has.  Run it after any change there.

### Debugging

Copy `vscode-launch-template.json` to `.vscode/launch.json` (relative to the main folder).
This gives you several launch profiles.  From the VS Code debugging view, launch the
`TEST` profile to start a dedicated Chrome window running vZome Online with breakpoints
available in the `online` sources.  That only starts the client side; you still need a dev
server running, per [Development](#development) above.

## Architecture Notes

See [this dedicated document](./developer-docs/architecture.html).

## History

After failing with `nwb` and `create-react-library`, I found this [recent blog post][mehrahinem], and I had been following it.

[mehrahinem]: https://medium.com/@mehrahinam/build-a-private-react-component-library-cra-rollup-material-ui-github-package-registry-1e14da93e790

However, that approach did not let me debug effectively.
I explored Vite, and then settled on Snowpack, but *only for dev*.  I still used CRA to do the build,
since Snowpack did not really do what I want with dependencies.

Now, however, I have switched completely to `esbuild`, after some help from Lucas Garron.
I'm building everything as ES6 modules, and `esbuild` does a great job with bundling and code splitting,
as well as being just plain fast.

I have also switched from React to SolidJS.  I found it to be very light and fast, and a better fit
for the event-based state management I need to do, where everything flows between the main context
and the web worker, getting mapped to the Controller architecture in the legacy code.
