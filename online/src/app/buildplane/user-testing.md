 - The rotate and drag gestures seem associated with the opposite mouse buttons.

 - Build mode is intuitive, until a move is desired, then it is surprising.

 - It is not obvious what to do with the hinge / plane selector.

 - It is VERY difficult to know how to find the plane you need if you get lost in the choices.

 - Movement of the disk feels like a camera move, even though the balls & struts don't move.  Easing / animation may help, or just moving the model.
