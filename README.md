# vZome

This is the source repository for [vZome](https://vzome.com/), a desktop application for creating virtual Zome models and exploring other constrained geometric realms.  In addition to the source for desktop vZome, this repository contains source code
for [vZome Online](https://vzome.com/app), which is a web application intended to eventually replace desktop vZome.
