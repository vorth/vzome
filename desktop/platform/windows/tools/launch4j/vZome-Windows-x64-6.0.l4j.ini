# This optional ini file is used to pass custom JVM options to vZome-Windows-x64-6.0.exe 
#  at runtime in addition to those specified during the launch4j build step.
# If the executable file is named vZome-Windows-x64-6.0.exe
# then the ini file must be named vZome-Windows-x64-6.0.l4j.ini
# It must be located in the same folder as the exe file.
# See http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/docs.html#Additional_jvm_options

# Here we enable various JOGL debugging flags.
# Logging levels must also be set in logging.properties to capture the resulting debug info.
# See http://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Jogl_FAQ#Detailed_Debug_Log
